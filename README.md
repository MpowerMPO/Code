The development of the Mpower Coin (MPO) is an extension of the joint venture launched in collaboration with the SASPRO (South African Solar Project). Saspro (SASP) is a project aimed at tokenizing the residential and SMME solar electricity.

A compelling use case for the Mpower Coin exist within the Mpower Coin/Saspro ecosystem in that all SASPRO customers who acquires a solar system for home use or business use will be required to pay for the electricity consumed utilizing the Mpower Coin exclusively.

Mpower is in a unique position that Master Node owners will always be assured that there will be a demand for the Mpower coins on exchanges and thus securing their investments for a steady and rising coin price over time.

Mpower is a sustainable, decentralized and peer-to-peer transactional cryptocurrency with a lower proof-of-work ratio to Master Node users which would lead to a stable, growing network. Decentralized blockchain voting providing for “consensus based advancement of the current Master Node technology” is used to secure the network.
